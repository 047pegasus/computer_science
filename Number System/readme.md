## Binary Number System
Binary Numbers only have two digits, 0 and 1. Binary numbers are used in computers because they are easy to represent using electronic circuits. Binary numbers are also used in digital electronics, such as digital cameras, digital watches, and digital televisions.

| Decimal | Binary |
|---------|--------|
| 0       | 0      |
| 1       | 1      |
| 2       | 10     |
| 3       | 11     |
| 4       | 100    |
| 5       | 101    |
| 6       | 110    |
| 7       | 111    |
| 8       | 1000   |
| 9       | 1001   |
| 10      | 1010   |

## Octal Number System
Octal Numbers have eight digits, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. The main advantage of using octal numbers is that they uses less digits than decimal numbers. Octal numbers are used in Unix and Linux operating systems.

| Decimal | Octal |
|---------|-------|
| 0       | 0     |
| 1       | 1     |
| 2       | 2     |
| 3       | 3     |
| 4       | 4     |
| 5       | 5     |
| 6       | 6     |
| 7       | 7     |
| 8       | 10    |
| 9       | 11    |
| 10      | 12    |

## Decimal Number System
Decimal Numbers have ten digits, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Decimal numbers are used in everyday life.

| Decimal | Decimal |
|---------|---------|
| 0       | 0       |
| 1       | 1       |
| 2       | 2       |

| 8       | 8       |
| 9       | 9       |
| 10      | 10      |

## Hexadecimal Number System
Hexadecimal Numbers have sixteen digits, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, and F. The Hexadecimal, or Hex, numbering system is commonly used in computer and digital systems to reduce large strings of binary numbers into a sets of four digits for us to easily understand

| Decimal | Hexadecimal |
|---------|-------------|
| 0       | 0           |
| 1       | 1           |
